TITLE

0x12. C - Singly linked lists. A singly linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains an element and a reference to the next node in the list


DESCRIPTION
The first node is called the head, and the last node is called the tail. The tail node typically has a reference to null, indicating the end of the list. Singly linked lists are useful for tasks such as insertion and deletion, but are less efficient for tasks such as random access.
